# kolkata-bus-gtfs
Get GTFS Format for bus transport routes in Kolkata City. 

# Why This Exists
Kolkata has one of the largest urban bus networks in India, yet no clean, publicly available structured dataset of its routes exists. Without this data, building transit apps, conducting transport research, or integrating Kolkata buses into tools like Google Maps is impossible.
This project creates that foundation — starting with manually verified route and stop data, structured in GTFS format, the international standard used by every major transit app in the world.

# How to Contribute Data
No coding experience needed. Just ride a bus.
